To Do:

Fix NOTES textarea:
Currently on reload, notes field turns all line breaks into 'rn', makes run on sentences.
1. once the file is loaded, change \r and \n to something else
2. stripslashes($output) (which is what we added last time)
3. capture the htmlentiteis() output of the textaera value ($myvariable = htmlentities($data['notes']) )
4. convert the "something else" back to \r and \n (you can use str_replace() for that sort of thing)
